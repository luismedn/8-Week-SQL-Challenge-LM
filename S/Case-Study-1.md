## Question and Solution

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM 
  dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN 
  dannys_diner.menu
ON 
  sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY 
  sales.customer_id
ORDER BY 
  sales.customer_id ASC;
````
### Step 1: Join the Tables
Use INNER JOIN to combine the dannys_diner.sales and dannys_diner.menu tables on the product_id column, which is common to both tables.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Sales
Apply the SUM function to the menu.price column to calculate the total sales amount for each customer.

### Step 3: Group and Order Results
Group the results by sales.customer_id to aggregate the sales per customer, and then order the output by sales.customer_id in ascending order.

### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

This shows the customer_id alongside the total_sales for each customer, based on the prices of the products they purchased.

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- SELECT Statement: We begin by selecting two columns: customer_id and the count of distinct order_date.
- COUNT(DISTINCT order_date): This function counts the unique dates on which each customer has placed an order, thereby representing their visit days.
- FROM Clause: The data is sourced from the dannys_diner.sales table, which contains records of customer orders.
- GROUP BY Clause: Finally, we group the results by customer_id to ensure that the visit count is calculated for each customer individually.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.
