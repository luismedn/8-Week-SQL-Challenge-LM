## Question and Solution

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM 
  dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN 
  dannys_diner.menu
ON 
  sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY 
  sales.customer_id
ORDER BY 
  sales.customer_id ASC;
````
### Step 1: Join the Tables
Use INNER JOIN to combine the dannys_diner.sales and dannys_diner.menu tables on the product_id column, which is common to both tables.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Sales
Apply the SUM function to the menu.price column to calculate the total sales amount for each customer.

### Step 3: Group and Order Results
Group the results by sales.customer_id to aggregate the sales per customer, and then order the output by sales.customer_id in ascending order.

### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

This shows the customer_id alongside the total_sales for each customer, based on the prices of the products they purchased.

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

***

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- SELECT Statement: We begin by selecting two columns: customer_id and the count of distinct order_date.
- COUNT(DISTINCT order_date): This function counts the unique dates on which each customer has placed an order, thereby representing their visit days.
- FROM Clause: The data is sourced from the dannys_diner.sales table, which contains records of customer orders.
- GROUP BY Clause: Finally, we group the results by customer_id to ensure that the visit count is calculated for each customer individually.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql
WITH ordered_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    s.order_date, 
    m.product_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY s.customer_id 
      ORDER BY s.order_date
    ) AS rank
  FROM 
    dannys_diner.sales s
  INNER JOIN 
    dannys_diner.menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
)

SELECT DISTINCT
  customer_id, 
  product_name
FROM 
  ordered_sales
WHERE 
  rank = 1;
````

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
Step 1: Organize and Rank Purchases
First, The WITH clause to create a temporary table called ordered_sales to organize all the sales:
````sql
WITH ordered_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    s.order_date, 
    m.product_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY s.customer_id 
      ORDER BY s.order_date
    ) AS rank
  FROM 
    dannys_diner.sales s
  INNER JOIN 
    dannys_diner.menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
)
````
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in this part:

customer_id: I'm grabbing the customer ID from the sales table.
order_date: This helps me determine the order in which the customer made their purchases.
product_name: I join the menu table to get the names of the products the customer bought.
DENSE_RANK(): This function is key because it lets me rank each customer‚Äôs purchases by their visit date. The first visit gets rank 1, and any items bought during that visit share the same rank.

Step 2: Filtering for First Visits

Now that I‚Äôve ranked each customer‚Äôs purchases by date, I‚Äôll filter out only those purchases that occurred on their first visit (rank = 1). I use DISTINCT to make sure I don‚Äôt list the same item multiple times if they bought it more than once on that visit.

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  customer_id, 
  product_name
FROM 
  ordered_sales
WHERE 
  rank = 1;
````
DISTINCT: This ensures that if a customer bought the same item twice on their first visit, it only shows up once.
WHERE rank = 1: I‚Äôm filtering to only show the products that were purchased on the first visit.

This query returns a list of customers along with the unique items they bought on their first visit. If a customer bought multiple items on that visit, all of those will be shown. However, the same item won‚Äôt be repeated if purchased multiple times on the same day.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | curry        | 
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer A placed an order for both curry and sushi simultaneously, making them the first items in the order.
- Customer B's first order is curry.
- Customer C's first order is ramen.
